This is a list of all of the meetings, mailings, and deadlines planned for Con of the North 2019. They include: 
*   **Magnetron Meetings** where you can see how the "day-to-day" operation of the convention.
*   Work parties like the **Event Scheduling Party**, where we need groups of people to do "assembly-line" duties. Stay afterwards and play some games!
*   The **Volunteer Parties**, which are great ways to meet other Con of the North Volunteers and learn more about volunteering opportunities.
*   [Timeline also available as a PDF document][1].
