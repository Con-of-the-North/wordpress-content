<h2>Welcome to Con of the North!</h2>
We are happy that you are interested in volunteering. Being a part of the team that puts on the area's premiere gaming convention will give you a feeling of accomplishment and achievement. Con of the North is an all-volunteer organization, so volunteering is the best way for you to contribute to the way the convention is run. Not only will volunteering give you valuable experience with management, people skills, organization and creativity, you will also meet new people and have fun!

We want to make it easy for you to fit in. We want you to find the best way to use your unique talents and skills to contribute in the areas that interest you. To help you along, this page contains basic information about how the convention operates and answers commonly asked questions.

There will probably be some questions you have that this page does not address. Feel free to attend any meeting, talk to any volunteer, or ask about the details of anything until you get the answers you are after. Each and every one of us at Con of the North wants you to enjoy volunteering, and we also want you to feel at home.

<span class="boldme">Remember</span>: Con of the North is a cooperative organization that relies on volunteer communication. If you never contact anyone it will be hard for them to help!
<h2>How the Convention Operates</h2>
The Magnetron Council is a group of seven volunteers elected yearly to oversee the various departments of the convention. They act as a final authority on proposals that affect the whole convention. All proposals that go before the Council must be written and all decisions about those proposals are made by the voting membership present at the meeting.

This does not mean that the Magnetron Council makes all the decisions or micromanages the work of every volunteer. The various departments have tremendous leeway in accomplishing their goals and completing their projects. The departments are able to projects and address problems in any way they see fit. The only time they need to involve the Council is when their project affects the whole convention in some way. Most decisions never go before the Council and are left up to the various departments of Con of the North.
