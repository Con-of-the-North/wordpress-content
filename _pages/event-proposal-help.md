What do all of the categories, checkboxes, and dropdowns on the Event Proposal form mean? The following guide should help you sort them out!!
### Game Types

* Board – Games that are played with some type of game board or boards. Ticket to Ride is a Board game.
* Card – Games that are played with just cards, both collectible and non-collectible. Magic the Gathering is a Collectible Card game, while Munchkin is a Non-collectible Card game.
* Computer – Games that are played on a computer or video game console. Starcraft is a Computer game.
* LARP – Live Action Role-Playing games. Usually most of the action is between the players where everyone is up and moving around, rather than sitting around a table.
* Miniatures – Games that are played on a battlefield using painted figures. Warhammer 40K is a Miniatures game.
* RPG – Role-Playing games. Generally each player controls a character in a story with other characters. Typically the action is between the characters and various non-player characters controlled by a GM with everyone seated at a table. Dungeons and Dragons is an RPG.
* Seminar – One or more individuals presenting information about a topic. Sometimes there is a question/answer component. Often called Panels.

### Rules Knowledge
Describes how well the players should know the rules, setting, and conventions of the game.

* None – You do not need any previous knowledge of the game or the rules to play this game. Any/all rules will be taught during play.
* Some – You should be familiar with the rules of this game or a very similar game. This means that you have played this game or a very similar game before once or twice. Some rules can be taught during play, but in general this is not for brand-new players.
* Advanced – You should be very familiar with the rules of this game. Very few, if any rules will be taught during play.

### Rating
Describes the content of your event. This lets players pick

* Everyone – This game will not have any profanity, little or no sexual innuendo, and violence will be brief, limited and not depicted in a graphic manner. Think of a standard G/PG animated movie.
* Teen – The game may have mild profanity and some violence. Intense themes may be present, but they will not be the focus of the game. GMs will ensure that the game is adjusted to accommodate any children present, but parents should be aware that this type of game may or may not be suitable for children. Games of this type may also not be suitable for young players because of the complexity of the rules. Think of  a standard PG-13 action movie.
* Mature – The game will have themes of an adult nature that are unsuitable for younger players. GMs will still ensure their game’s content remains such that it can be played in any convention space without causing problems. Think of this as a mainstream/Hollywood R-rated action or horror movie.
* Kid Only – This game will be kid-friendly with subject matter appropriate for younger players. We recommend you mention in the game description if you prefer adults to accompany their minors/guardians at the game.

### Required Materials
Describes what, if anything, players need to bring to your event. For events that require materials, we recommend listing/summarizing what is needed in the event description, if possible.

* None – All materials needed to play the game are provided. The player does not need anything, including dice. Most Board and Non-collectible Card games fit this category, as do many of the LARPs run at CotN.
* General – Players need their own generic materials like pencils, dice, and such. These items may be available if others at the table are kind. The GM will provide specific materials such as characters, minis, etc. Most RPGs fit this category.
* All – Players must supply their own equipment to play this game: decks, armies, characters, and similar, along with the things listed under General. The GM will provide only the most basic materials needed for play, like the game board. Many Miniatures and Collectible Card games, some RPGs.

### Tracks
There will be two special tracks this year that GMs can choose to list their games in. Descriptions of the tracks will be listed in the front of the book, but the individual games will not. Lists of the games in these tracks will be compiled and made available on the website as well as the registration desk onsite. Events can be in both tracks.

* Intro/Learn to Play Track – This is for games that are targeted specifically at someone who has never played before. The rules will be taught before and during the game. This means turns may take a lot longer than normal and there may be a lot of questions from players. Experienced players need to be aware of this and be willing to assist new players if they choose to play in these games.
* Kid-Friendly Track – This is for games where children are the preferred players.


### Time Slots

Con of the North 2019 uses a Time Slot system to schedule events. Each event slot is 2, 4, 6, or 8 hours long and starts on an even-numbered hour. The names are a combination of the day and the start and end times for the slot in 24-hour/military time.

GMs should plan to begin their event on time and wrap up 5-15 minutes before the end of their chosen time slot to allow time to pack up everyone’s things, clean up the table, and for everyone to get to their next event. Tables must be surrendered at your event’s ending time to allow the next event to start.

All Convention events (marked as “ALL-CON”) are ones which do not have a specific start or end time. Typically these are events you can join in at any time. If you would like to run something like this, note it in your Special Requirements box and email us at info@conofthenorth.org before submitting your proposal. ALL-CON events must be submitted by the event deadline to be considered.

### Sponsoring Organization

A Sponsoring Organization is any club, store, publisher, or other organization that sponsors an event or events.

Organizations must email a request to be a Sponsor before they can be listed as the sponsor of an event for that convention year. Only one request needs to be submitted out per organization, no matter how many events they’re sponsoring. We will ask the Sponsoring Organization to verify the list of events to make sure the list is correct.

All Sponsors will be listed in the Event Book along with the events they’re sponsoring and the description and website provided on the form.
