<span style="font-weight: 400;">A games convention is a gathering of people (usually annually) where everyone gets together to have a good time. This is accomplished in general by playing games and participating in other activities.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The games played at a convention are very wide ranging. Role playing games (such as D&D, Call of Cthulhu or Pathfinder), card games (Apples to Apples, Illuminati), war games (World in Flames), board games (Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride), miniatures games (Warhammer 40K), computer games (Artemis SBS, Minecraft, Quake2, Unreal Tournament), LARP (Society in Shadow) and many more.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to participate in the games you just register for the convention and then sign up for games, either in advance (by pre-registering), or at the convention.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New or inexperienced players are usually welcome to play or watch as they prefer.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other activities at a games convention include costume events, auctions, volunteering, hanging out and talking, going without enough sleep and other good times.</span>
