Event Tickets are not available yet, but when event registration opens in November, you'll use the same <a href="https://registration.conofthenorth.org/">registration</a> website to register for your games.

The event ticket selection process is split in to 2 phases.
<h3>Phase 1 - Event Preselection</h3>
For the first phase, which we're calling Event Preselection, will close at the end of December. In this phase, you'll have the ability to select up to 20 events that you're interested in attending, and they will be placed in a ranked order that you set.  The events you are most interested in attending should be set near the top (Rank 1).

Once Event Preselection closes, the system will then go through and try to assign you up to 8 of your selected events to give you a good strong start on your schedule for the convention. The system will not provide alternate (waiting list) tickets in the assignment - any ticket provided to an attendee would be a guaranteed seat at the table.  During the assignment, the system will skip over time slots you already received an event for.
<h3>Phase 2 - Live Selection</h3>
The second phase will allow you to see all of the events that the system has automatically assigned you based on your preselection as well as allow you to add new events, or give back your ticket on events you currently have assigned. At this time, there is no priority system - everyone will have access to select events to fill up their schedule in a first come, first served basis. This phase is set to close at the end of January.

During this phase you'll be able to see what events are still open, which ones only have alternate (waiting list) tickets, and which ones are fully sold out; think of it as an online shopping cart. You'll not be able to select events which would cause a scheduling conflict (having tickets for multiple games running at the same time), even if they are alternate tickets. If you change your mind on an event and decide you no longer want it, you can remove it from your assignments allowing another person to grab the ticket, and freeing up that time slot for you to select a new event.

What you have assigned to you on the website are the tickets you'll be getting when you pick up your folder at the convention.
