We recognize and respect your need for privacy and security as you visit our Website at [conofthenorth.org](http://conofthenorth.org). When you visit our site, you do so without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. While we do not collect identifying information about visitors to our site, we do use standard software to collect information for the strict purpose of tracking activity on our site. This allows us to better understand how many people use our site and which pages are the most popular. The information we normally collect and store includes:

* The domain name of your Internet service provider.
* The Web site that referred you to us (if any).
* The agent string from your browser.
* The pages and/or files you requested.
* The date and time the pages and/or files were accessed.

There are instances where you may elect to provide us with personal information. If you fill out one of our registration, request, or feedback forms or send us email, you are transmitting the information that appears to you in the form or the message. This will typically include your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, the kind of request you are making, and any other information necessary to fulfill your request. You never transmit personally identifying information that you do not enter yourself. Using these forms is always your option; this information cannot be collected unless you specifically elect to send it to us.

This information is used only for the purpose of registering you for the convention, presenting your events, fulfilling your requests, or for contacting you directly. It is not given or sold to any other organization. However, we may be required to provide personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, or to release personal information if we in good faith believe such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy. A revised policy statement will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date. Any revisions will be posted at least 30 days prior to its effective date.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please email us at [webmaster@conofthenorth.org](mailto:webmaster@conofthenorth.org).
