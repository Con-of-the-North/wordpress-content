<h2>Preregistration</h2>
Preregistration for Con of the North 2019 is open! Simply head over to <a href="https://registration.conofthenorth.org/">registration</a>. If you registered online last year, you should be able to use the same username and password. If you haven't used the online registration system before, you can set up a new username and password.

Another item of note is that for the first time in 15 years (2003), we’ve raised our registration prices. We’ve been proud to keep the convention as economically minded as possible since we are a non-profit and volunteer-run organization, but to keep up with the rising costs of our gaming space and other expenses, we’ve finally had to bite the bullet to keep the convention running smoothly. Full weekend preregistration is now $30 (up from $25) and full weekend onsite registration has been increased to $40 (up from $37).
