There are two ways a GM or group of GMs are able to reserve a dedicated space for their events for the whole convention. A space consists of one or more tables. If more than one table is requested the following policies apply to each table separately.

The following are requirements of either option:
<ul>
 	<li>The GM must <a href="mailto:info@conofthenorth.org">contact the convention</a> prior to submitting anything.</li>
 	<li>For requests that will have multiple GMs, one GM must be designated as the primary contact for the group and will be responsible for all communications and submissions for the request.</li>
 	<li>After consultation with Programming, the GM must submit a space proposal form that lists all of the events/GMs that will use the space.</li>
 	<li>The game proposal forms for each event must all be submitted at the same time as the space proposal together in a single packet by the game submission deadline. Programming will work with the contact GM to determine the best method for submitting the events together.</li>
 	<li>All GMs must be registered with the convention as either a Judge or Referee. Ideally all GMs will be registered by the event submission deadline. However if there are groups that need to organize volunteers, alternate timelines can be worked out with Programming. The contact GM must be registered by the event submission deadline regardless and should work to ensure that their other GMs are registered as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
The first option is the non-pay option. It has the following requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>The space must have games scheduled for at least 85% of the convention. <strong>Any type or combination of types of games may be used</strong> to fulfill the hour requirement.</li>
 	<li>For spaces that have ticketed events, all events must follow the convention's schedule/ticket policies and must be listed in the events book.</li>
 	<li>For spaces that have non-ticketed events (like most All-Con events) the GM must submit a description of the event(s) taking place in the space along with a schedule of when the event will be running and the name of the GM(s) running it. These non-ticketed events must also be scheduled for at least 85% of the con.</li>
 	<li>Other events may be scheduled in the space when it is not being used by the group, based on the needs of the convention.</li>
</ul>
The second option is the pay option. It has the following requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>The GM pays the convention to reserve the space for the entire convention.</li>
 	<li>This also allows the GM to use the space however they want.</li>
 	<li>Games do not have to be scheduled/ticketed, but are still only open to paid con attendees. (Those wearing a Player, Judge, or Vendor badge.)</li>
 	<li>The GM may submit game proposals for any scheduled games they would like to have in the space. These games must follow the same procedures and deadlines as any other event to be included in the Events Book.</li>
 	<li>They get a short blurb in the book to promote the space.</li>
 	<li>The fee paid for this space is based on the number of tables used. For larger spaces, the number of tables used is defined as the number of tables the convention would normally place in that area, not the number of tables the group will use. The per table price is a starting point and may be increased by the convention if the group has special requests and/or if there are additional costs charged by the hotel for their setup.</li>
 	<li>The per table fee for CotN 2019 is $150.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Theme_Rooms"></a>What Happened to Theme Rooms?</h3>
In 2014, the convention moved to a larger hotel with a very different configuration of space. It has several small rooms that are part of the normal convention space, but they are meeting rooms rather than hotel rooms and almost all have enough space for multiple tables.

In an effort to allow as many people as possible an opportunity to run their events in these smaller rooms, we introduced new options for GMs like Tracks and Dedicated Space. Groups that have run Theme Rooms in the past should be able to achieve a similar experience using the Non-Pay Dedicated Space option, but now GMs who run other types of events can get the same benefits.

As always, the convention is willing to try to schedule all of a GM's events on the same tables, even if you do not meet the time requirements for a Dedicated Space. If your group would like to have your games on the same table, please <a href="mailto:conofthenorth.org">contact the convention</a> before submitting any events.
