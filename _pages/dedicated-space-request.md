* Dedicated space is available on a limited basis to individual GMs, companies, organizations, and gaming groups, including organized or social/informal groups of GMs. If you would like to request a dedicated space for your events, please follow the steps below.
* We’ve made some changes to clarify the process, make the dedicated space program more flexible, while ensuring our hotel spaces are allocated in the best possible way.
* **Step 1: Register for the convention**
* All GMs must be registered with the convention as either a Judge or Referee before the event submission deadline. If your group has special concerns regarding this, please contact us. All GMs must agree to Con of the North’s GM Policies, Code of Conduct and Harassment Policy.
* **Step 2: Decide what space you need**
* Dedicated space can be requested in two ways: Dedicated table(s) or dedicated room. For either option, a minimum number of hours per table must be met in order to be considered for a dedicated space. Locations and rooms will be awarded based on the number of tables requested.
* ***Option 1:*** Table(s) per day
* You can request a table or set of tables for your events, for any single day or combination of days of the convention. The table(s) may or may not be in a room shared with other convention events. The GM/group must run events on each table requested for a minimum of:


* 10 hours (5 time slots) on Friday
* 12 hours (6 time slots) on Saturday
* 10 hours (5 time slots) on Sunday


* ***Option 2:*** Table(s) and room
* You can request room with a table or set of tables for your events. The GM/group must run 32 hours of events on each table, with a minimum number of:


* 4 hours (2 time slots) on Friday
* 12 hours (6 time slots) on Saturday
* 4 hours (2 time slots) on Sunday


* The remaining 12 hours may be scheduled any day and time available in the room.
* If additional time or table space is needed without meeting the minimum hours, or if you’re running open (also called all-con) events, you must contact the convention and provide the reason for the time and tables requested.
* **Step 3: Request the Dedicated Space**
* Email the convention ([info@conofthenorth.org](mailto:info@conofthenorth.org)) prior to submitting events with the following information:

* Group Name
* Lead Coordinator’s Name
* Lead Coordinator’s Email
* Lead Coordinator’s Phone
* If you are a company, organization, or formally organized group and wish to be listed as the event sponsor
* The dedicated space option you are requesting

* Single table
* Multiple tables
* Room


* Primary type of games being run


* The deadline for dedicated space requests is September 15, 2018, two weeks prior to the event submission deadline. In the interest of fairness in scheduling both our dedicated space groups and our independent GMs, we will not be able to accommodate any late requests for dedicated space.
* **Step 4: Submit your events**
* The programming department will let you know if your request has been approved. Then when you are ready, log in to the online registration site and submit the events. The deadline to submit all events for dedicated spaces is September 29, 2018.
