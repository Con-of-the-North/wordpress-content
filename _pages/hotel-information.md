<span style="font-weight: 400;">Con of the North 2019 will be at the Crowne Plaza Minneapolis West. You can reserve a room by calling the hotel at (763) 559-6600 (we recommend you do not use their online reservation system as it often incorrectly claims the room block is full when there is space available). The convention Group Code for 2019 is CNF â€“ please be sure to reference that during the room reservation process!</span>
