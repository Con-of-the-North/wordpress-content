As an Attendee at Con of the North, you agree to abide by these guidelines:

* Be courteous and polite to other attendees.
* Show up for your events: If you decide to not attend an event, return the ticket to the Registration desk so other attendees can use it.
* Similarly, don’t take event tickets you aren’t going to use.
* Weapons, whether real or fake, are not allowed in the convention areas.
* Parents, you are still responsible for your children while they are at the convention.
* Be kind to yourself and your fellow attendees; practice good personal hygiene during the convention weekend.
* Do not do anything illegal at the convention. Any illegal activities will be reported to the authorities.
* Don’t drink and game; alcohol is not allowed in the convention areas.
* Most importantly, have fun!
