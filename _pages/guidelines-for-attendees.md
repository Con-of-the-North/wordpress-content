<strong>As an Attendee at Con of the North, you agree to abide by these guidelines:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Be courteous and polite to other attendees.</li>
 	<li>Show up for your events. If you decide to not attend an event, return the ticket to the Registration desk so other attendees can use it.</li>
 	<li>Similarly, don't take event tickets you aren't going to use.</li>
 	<li>Weapons, whether real or fake, are not allowed in the convention areas.</li>
 	<li>Parents, you are still responsible for your children while they are at the convention.</li>
 	<li>Be kind to yourself and your fellow attendees: practice good personal hygiene during the convention weekend.</li>
 	<li>Do not do anything illegal at the convention. Any illegal activities will be reported to the authorities.</li>
 	<li>Don't drink and game: alcohol is not allowed in the convention areas.</li>
 	<li>Most importantly, have fun!</li>
</ul>
