### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pickup Events/Open Gaming</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the deadline has passed, you can always run an event or play a game onsite! To run a pickup event, stop by the convention registration desk and ask for a table in the desired timeslot. We have a whiteboard where you can write information about your event, and we are happy to give non-scheduled games whatever space we can.</span>
