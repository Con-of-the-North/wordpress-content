### Online Event Submission

* All registration and event submission is done through the [Online Registration Site](https://registration.conofthenorth.org/).
* If you have a Sponsoring Organization, fill out the [Online Sponsor Info Form](http://conofthenorth.com/eventsponsorform.php).

### Pickup Events/Open Gaming
Even if the deadline has passed, you can always run an event or play a game onsite! To run a pickup event, stop by the convention registration desk and ask for a table in the desired timeslot. We have a whiteboard where you can write information about your event, and we are happy to give non-scheduled games whatever space we can.
